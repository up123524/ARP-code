# ARP-code
Code I worked on to form the basis of my report for my project. It was written in R as my preferential programming language and involved my analysing a paper constructing a series of simple trading rules. These rules would theoretically provide an investor with limited data access and the ability to find consistent returns. I used this code to evaluate these trading rules and their effectiveness in forming a portfolio. 

My main difficulty in this project was finding the original data with many sources being restricted or non-existant. In order to get around this I either validated alternative data sets that closely matched the pattern of the data, changing the level of the data by using a different metric that minimised loss of information. Or using Monte-Carlo simulations to generate synthetic data. While these methods had shortcomings I was pleased that I was able to reliably recreate the results of the original paper. 

I was unsuprised by the results that differences in time Epochs did not create a portfolio that performed as well as the original however, I enjoyed toying with markets and asset classes to find a diversified portfolio which perfomed well on standard financial tests such as the Sharpe ratio.
